pudlez-tools repo created
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to sakaki-tools starting to throw warnings/errors, I decided I would
create my own repo based off sakaki's repo. I will eventually be adding
more ebuilds.

Please note that this repo is mostly for me but I'm not against others
using it. If you have issues, please let me know and I can try fixing
it but in no way do a guarentee I will fix everything...
